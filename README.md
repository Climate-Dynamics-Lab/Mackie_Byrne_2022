Analysis code for 'Effects of circulation on tropical cloud feedbacks in high resolution-simulations', Anna Mackie & Michael P. Byrne, submitted to JAMES, 2023.

Pre-print: https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10509780.1

Code is split into two main parts:
1. Processing - this is where each individual model is time and space averaged for 2D and 3D variables, including cloud fraction. Done individually due to model differences in naming/indexing etc.
2. Analysis - these scripts perform the analysis of the manuscript, and produce the Figures and SI Figures.

Common functions are under funcs.py
