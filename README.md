Analysis code for Effects of circulation on tropical cloud feedbacks in high resolution-simulations, submitted to JAMES, 2022.

Code is split into two main parts:
1. Processing - this is where each individual model is time and space averaged for 2D and 3D variables, including cloud fraction
2. Analysis - these scripts perform the analysis of the manuscript, and produce the Figures and SI Figures.
